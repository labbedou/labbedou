- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @labbedou, a developer on the Factory Supply Chain CALP team.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things web development - especially React JS. Outside of work I'm a big sports fan (Go Suns!, Go Cardinals!, Go Coyotes! (baseball is ok too)), and a bit of a gamer. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Find me on Teams or douglas.labbe@intel.com
